EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Dataset Overview
•	Rows & Columns: 891 rows × 12 columns
•	Target Variable: Survived (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
•	Missing Values:
o	Age → 177 missing
o	Cabin → 687 missing
o	Embarked → 2 missing
•	Categorical Columns: Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked
•	Numerical Columns: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare

Summary of Findings

•	Survival Factors: Higher-class passengers and those who paid higher fares had better survival rates.
•	Demographics: Majority of passengers were between 20–40 years old; more males than females.
•	Fare Distribution: Highly skewed — few wealthy passengers paid much higher fares.
•	Class Impact: Strong link between passenger class and survival; Pclass 1 had the highest survival.
•	Correlation Insights: Fare and Pclass are moderately correlated with survival; Age had little direct correlation.
